This code was part of a class project.

I added this to help others understand the way I code and document them.

The best way to see this is by navigating to the project folder. 

Once inside the project folder go into the src folder where you can see a list of classes.

I would recomended reading manpage.h to get a better sense of the project and also looking over the bus, route, passenger, and stop classes.

You can also go into the test folder to see the various test I wrote for the code.

I would like to note that I did not write all of the code you see majority of the code for the web aspect was provided along with others. 

I did however add a lot of things in the 4 major classes.
