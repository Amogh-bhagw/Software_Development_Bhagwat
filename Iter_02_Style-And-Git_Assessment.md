		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-10 (HEAD, tag: Iter2D2-master) Merge branch 'devel' - Merging final verison of bus sim for iteration 2 

		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-10 (tag: Iter2D2-devel, origin/devel, origin/add/18-singleton-pattern, add/18-singleton-pattern) Merge branch 'add/17-Documentation-2' into devel - Adding documentation and google style edits

- I also self documented code and deoxygen new code.
- Everything is up to google complint.


		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-10 Merge branch 'add/16-Bus-Depot' into devel - Added a bus depot and 3 strategy and also fixed google style complents in the src 

		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-10 (origin/add/16-Bus-Depot, add/16-Bus-Depot) fix(IObservable.cc/h, IObserver.h, bus_factory.cc/h, r_local_simulator.cc/h, r_local_simulator_2.cc/h, rtest_passenger_generator.cc): fix #16 Added a bus depot - I added three strategies to the bus factory class. Depending on the
current time one of the three strategies will be implemented.
- I also
fixed any google style issues in the src dirctory.


		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-07 Merge branch 'add/15-observer-pattern' into devel - Added a observer pattern for the bus, so users can focus on one bus 

		[Amogh Bhagwat] 2020-04-07 (origin/add/15-observer-pattern, add/15-observer-pattern) fix(r_local_simulator.h,IObservable.cc/h, IObserver.h, bus.cc/h, main.cpp, my_web_server_command.cc/h, visualization_simulator.cc/h, sketch.js): fix #15 added a Observer pattern for bus - For the Simulation I added a observer pattern. In order to do this we
needed to add a space for the observer in sketch.js, add a command, two
new classes IObserver and IObservable, and I also  made changes to the pause
command a little.
- If you want to know what gets printed for the bus observer checkout
the web_server_command to see the Bus Web Observer class
